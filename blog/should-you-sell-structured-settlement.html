      <p class="text-muted">Updated May 2025 · 6 min read</p>

      <p><strong>Structured settlements</strong> can be a helpful financial resource — but life happens. You may find yourself needing fast access to cash. That’s when many people consider a lump sum payout.</p>

      <h2>When Is It Smart to Sell?</h2>
      <p>Selling your structured settlement may make sense if you're facing urgent needs such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Paying off high-interest debt</li>
        <li>Funding education or a home</li>
        <li>Starting a business</li>
        <li>Medical or family emergencies</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Is It Legal?</h2>
      <p>Yes — selling a structured settlement is 100% legal and <strong>requires court approval</strong>. This ensures your decision is in your best interest and protected by law.</p>

      <h2>How Do You Sell It?</h2>
      <p>SmarterPayouts offers a <a href="../pricingcalculator.html" class="text-success">100% online calculator</a> that shows your payout instantly. No pressure. No sensitive information.</p>
      <p>After you accept an offer, we handle all the legal paperwork and file your request with the court.</p>

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
